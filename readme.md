# IERG4210 Assignment Phase 1

Name: Lau Long Ching

SID: 1155127347

## Description
This project layout is developed with Bootstrap 5 and JQuery. However, I have made some customizations:
- The website supports dark theme.
- Extra JQuery functions are written to let the shopping cart window popover stays on hover.
- The website has implemented responsive UI.

Please refer to https://github.com/leightonllc/IERG4210 for the git record.

## Phase 1 marking checklist
1. HTML: Make good use of semantic HTML throughout the whole assignment.

- ```<header> <nav> <footer> <div> <section> <ul> <li>``` etc. ✅

2. CSS: Clean separation of HTML, CSS and JS code and files throughout the whole assignment.

- No inline CSS and JS are allowed ✅
- No HTML for styling use, e.g. ```<center> align="center"``` etc. ✅
- Tolerance: < 5 exceptions

3. Main page demonstrates the use of “CSS table-less” product list

- Each product has at least its own thumbnail, name, price, and addToCart button ✅
- When the thumbnail or name is clicked, redirect to the corresponding product page ✅

4. Main page demonstrates the use of “CSS hover” shopping list

- When displayed, it will cover any elements behind ✅
- Input boxes are used for inputting the quantity of each selected product ✅
- A checkout button is used (supposed to submit the list to PayPal, currently no function) ✅
- The shopping list is displayed on both main and product pages ✅

5. Product page provides product details

- To show a full-size or bigger image, name, description, price, and addToCart button ✅
- To display the inventory of the item ✅

6. Both main and product pages should include a hierarchical navigation menu

- e.g., Home or Home > Category1 or Home > Category1 > Product1 ✅
- They are hyperlinks that can redirect users to an upper level of the hierarchy ✅
